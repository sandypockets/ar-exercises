# Add validations to two models to enforce the following business rules:


# Ask the user for a store name (store it in a variable)
# Attempt to create a store with the inputted name but leave out the other fields (annual_revenue, mens_apparel, and womens_apparel)
# Display the error messages provided back from ActiveRecord to the user (one on each line) after you attempt to save/create the record
